## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-22

### Changed
- Configured asset download path to use `public/tmp_assets` via `TMP_ASSETS_PATH` environment variable.
- Improved asset fetching logic to ensure target directory exists before starting downloads.
- Updated ESLint configuration to ignore `.venv` and `public/tmp_assets` for faster and more reliable linting.
- Fixed unused `os` import in `fetch-assets.ts`.

### Security
- Verified that temporary assets are ignored by Git to avoid leaking user data or bloating the repository.
