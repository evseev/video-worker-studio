## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Integrated Supabase for user authentication and project ownership.
- Integrated Inngest for reliable background processing of long-running video generation tasks.
- Added middleware to protect application routes from unauthenticated access.
- Moved video asset fetching and generation logic into asynchronous Inngest functions.

### Security
- Fixed a critical command injection vulnerability in the asset fetching module by switching to `execFile` and safely passing arguments.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-05-22

### Changed
- Configured asset download path to use `public/tmp_assets` via `TMP_ASSETS_PATH` environment variable.
- Improved asset fetching logic to ensure target directory exists before starting downloads.
- Updated ESLint configuration to ignore `.venv` and `public/tmp_assets` for faster and more reliable linting.
- Fixed unused `os` import in `fetch-assets.ts`.

### Security
- Verified that temporary assets are ignored by Git to avoid leaking user data or bloating the repository.
